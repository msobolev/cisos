= Where do I get the Hello Bar code for this plugin? =

You can get your own Hello Bar account from [HelloBar.com](http://www.hellobar.com/) for free.
Once you have your account, create a Hello Bar and simply paste your code into the plugin's text area.

= Should I load my Hello Bar in the header or the footer of my WordPress site? =

This depends on your site. We recommend loading the script in the footer but if your page takes very long to load, the header might be a better location.
