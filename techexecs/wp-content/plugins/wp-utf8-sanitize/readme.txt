This plugin is designed to handle the broken characters that might appear on your blog posts, if their content is converted from/to UTF8 and ISO-8859-1.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to &#8220;<em>fight</em>&#8221; the broken UTF8 
characters on your WordPress powered site.

Install the <em><strong>UTF8 Sanitize WordPress plugin</strong></em> and you 
will be able to fight those ugly characters. Additionally, you can customize 
what actions you want to perform on them - either convert them to their original 
values once and for all by modifing your posts&#8217; database, OR leave all 
your posts intact and instead convert the ugly chars each time a post is loaded 
(all these options are controlled from the WordPress admin panel).
