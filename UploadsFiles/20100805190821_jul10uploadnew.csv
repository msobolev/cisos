What most companies define as Customer Experience Management never really touches the customer; since their slice of the customer base is extremely small. Empathica; on the other hand; is at the forefront of delivering more actionable customer insights on a broad scale. I’m thrilled to join a company that allows brands to reach out directly to their customers to obtain rich factual data which they can use to make better; more informed decisions based on reality -- rather than the perception of it.”                                                                                                                                                                                             About Empathica:                                                                                                                                                                                              Empathica provides Customer Experience Management programs to more than 200 of the world’s leading brands; ranging from multi-unit retailers; to banks and restaurants.

Bonnell's office will be in Town Hall; but the job is split 60-40 with the School Department; Tremblay said; with Bonnell working in the schools 60 percent of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                             The school district's savings will likely be a ""wash;"" Tremblay said; with the retirement of another teacher in the district.
