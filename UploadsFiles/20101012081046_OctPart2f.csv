In fact; the past two years have seen the volume of malware threats exceed the cumulative total of the preceding 30+ years. The traditional approach to malware defence has passed the point of diminishing returns. I have searched for the innovation in this industry and it is lacking. Today's anti-malware industry is more about clever marketing than revolutionary technology.”<br>Mel Morris; CEO of Prevx; said: “Having personally known Christopher for many years; it is truly an honour to have such a high-calibre industry pioneer on board as Prevx continues to grow in size and strength. Today's cyber criminals are waging a sophisticated; technology-led war on three fronts; social engineering; zero-day exploits and state of the art covert techniques that make traditional malware research increasingly blind to their attacks.
