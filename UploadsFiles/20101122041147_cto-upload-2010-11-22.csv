The list includes the name and organization of each applicant; documents demanded and dates the information was requested and is due to be released./brA new state law merely requires city departments to maintain such a log — not to post it on the Internet to tip investigative reporters about the trail being followed by competitors./brBut Daley gleefully declared he was going ""above and beyond what's required"" in the interest of ""transparency; openness and the free flow of information.""/br""If you want transparency in government; you have to have this.

Much publicized changes to Canadian tax rules have yet to generate benefits./brHopefully; Ottawa can still turn the page and avoid more setbacks like the closing of once promising startups like Liquid Computing and fire sales of Kleer and Neterion./brThe Ottawa participants include some companies that have received public attention like eSight; which is developing technology for people with seeing impairment; Chinook Mobile Heating and Deicing aimed at airports; YouiLabs; which makes a graphics software processor and Protecode; which helps manage open source software./brIt also features relative unknowns like Zeebu; which makes a child's education game application for BlackBerry and Sparq Systems of Kingston; which makes a power converter for solar panels./brGazaro and Patientway are carefully managing resources as they search for market openings./brGazaro's Alexander Rink said that sales have risen 500 per cent and the number of users of its e commerce site have risen 60 per cent in the last four months./brThe service lets people in the hunt for electronics know where the deals are; relying on software that mines databases for instant price movements and comparing them in deal score./brBoth companies have about 10 employees with plans to hire more./brGazaro is supported by Apption Software which is developing artificial intelligence and service oriented software for the public and private sector and helped support Gazaro's real time software offering./brRink counts Inforetrieval and Publivage among the startups he developed./brSam Zaid; the founding Gazaro CEO; is now the chief technology officer./brPatientway was spawned by Infonium; a company that helped the Ontario government build a spending accountability standard for hospitals./brThat experience led to a new company aimed at aimed at easing the cost and frustration of getting patients in front of doctors./brLawrence said the Patientway technology is being implemented at Kemptville District Hospital; the Stronach Cancer Centre in Newmarket and Grey Bruce Health Services in Owen Sound./brBy speeding the flow of information between doctors' offices scheduling hospital tests; he said hospitals can reduce clerical loads by 30 per cent./brPatients can swipe special cards in hospital kiosks; reducing the traditional eight to 10 minute registration wait to 30 seconds./brBut hospitals are slow to adopt new technology with taxpayers and opposition parties vigilant for any seeming evidence of waste.

The U.S. health care system is now in a state of war. Consumers; government regulators and enterprises are demanding change; otherwise; alternatives will be created and the current system will be shoved aside./brFour major events are creating a timeline that the existing health care system must meet in order to survive:/br1. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Health Care Reform) passed in March 2010 will create an alternative health care system if the current one cannot evolve./br2. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Stimulus Funding) provides $37B to kickstart the evolution but acts as both a carrot with rewards and a stick with penalties./br3. The ICD 10 coding standard for medical records was passed by the United Nations in 1994 yet the U.S. has largely not deployed it. Current regulatory requirements will force its adoption./br4. There are growing demand for accountability and increased penalties for noncompliance under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); as well as for data breaches involving protected health information (PHI)./br/brThese regulatory barrages on the current health care system are forcing change within an environment that has tremendous inertia against change. Change is risky and expensive; and evolving incorrectly will affect more than revenues   it will affect lives./brCroslin understands the limitations of the current U.S. health care system to evolve. Without a dramatically different approach; the existing IT infrastructure will not be able to meet the regulatory mandates or take advantage of the rewards offered by stimulus funding. /brCroslin has joined IQware as CIO/CTO; stating: ""IQware's patented technologies allow a completely different approach to how IT departments and systems evolve. The U.S. health care system desperately needs a way to become innovative overnight. IQware's foundational systems provide this innovative; evolutionary platform without incurring the traditional risk; complexity and expense. The ability to create unique solutions in record time that deliver secure and highly customizable and targetable applications is unique to IQware.""/brExecutive teams are praising Croslin's innovation process; detailed in his book Innovate the Future; at leading companies including ATT; Alcatel Lucent and Rogers Communications. Across global markets; including the U.S.; Europe; China and the Middle East; all reviews are overwhelmingly positive: ZDnet; TechForum; CIOInsight/Baseline; Dr. Dobb's Journal; TechTarget; I CIO; British Computer Society; Amazon and many others./brIQware will be heavily involved with making the evolution of the U.S. health care system an innovative success./brContact: /brDavid Croslin/brdcroslin@iqwaremarketing.com/br(719) 266 3288 /brhttp://www.iqwaremarketing.com ",,100-250,$10-50 Million,Press Release,,Iqware appointed David Croslin as Chief Technology Officer,David Croslin was previously the Chief Technologist at Hewlett Packard.,IQWARE has been providing state of the art global hospitality management products and services to hotels; condos; resorts; spas and multi property locations since 1984.,http://www.prnewswire.com/newsreleases/iqwaredeliversimmediateinnovationsasushealthcareindustryfeelsextremepressuretoevolve103920163.html

Trinity Medical Center will relocate to its unfinished hospital on US 280.” This was the endlessly touted digital hospital that was to serve as the flagship for the HealthSouth rehab chain; to have been built by HealthSouth and Oracle. It was called the “hospital of the future” when construction began in 2001; which turned out to be apropos since Richard Scrushy’s $2.7 billion fraud scandal left it permanently unfinished. It was vaporware anyway; said HealthSouth’s CEO last year: “It was a pipe dream and a figment of the imagination. It never had a chance.” You would have believed otherwise given the gushy coverage by the bootlicking healthcare rags back in the day; which were apparently unaware that Oracle had pretty much nothing to offer hospitals despite periodic; uninspired healthcare waters toe dipping. /brFrom RegularReader: “Re: Broadlane. MedAssets buys competing GPO/services company Broadlane for $850M Tuesday and the Street doesn’t exactly love it. Stock is down approximately 10% since the deal was announced. Only time will tell how many jobs the expected $20M in 2011 expense based synergies represents.” MedAssets shares closed Thursday at $18.54; down from Tuesday’s peak of $21.50. /brFrom Willie Maquitt: “Re: Adreima. Where do companies come up with these names? How do you pronounce it?” Advocacy for Reimbursement Matters; like George “T Bone” Costanza in Seinfeld; decides to give itself a contrived nickname; Adreima; maybe to celebrate its acquisition this week of eligibility vendor Hospital Inpatient Services. I’d say it “addREEmah”; but I hate it when companies make up a name of their own free will; then insist on shortening it. Why not just pick a short one to start with? /brFrom Human Error; Here: “Re: Pittsburgh. The executive; who spent $10 million of taxpayer money on an emergency dispatch system upgrade (downgrade) when the county and city can barely afford to patch potholes blames human error for care delays.” The new system was missing addresses and landmarks; so dispatchers got confused when multiple surrounding towns share the same street address. A dispatcher who sent police to a cell phone tower instead of a house to check out a break in was suspended indefinitely. I’m not sure if that’s better or worse than in Detroit; where ambulances don’t have computers or GPSs; ambulance response times are long; and firefighters and police officers aren’t allowed to help a victim until the ambulance gets there. /brFrom TexLAHawk: “Re: JPS Health Network; Texas. Word is that Jamey Pennington has resigned as CIO. So basically a county facility that has historically had terrible management and clinical outcomes now is set to buy the most expensive; resource intensive EMR possible without a CIO at the helm. Glad to see our tax dollars are hard at work!” I’ll guess the CIO part is true since JPS IT director Joe Venturelli sent a Rumor Report to mention that the book he wrote; The Informed Patient; is available on iTunes (or at least it claimed to be him) and mentioned his role as interim CIO. They couldn’t force the CIO to stay if he wanted to leave; of course; and I’m sure that he’s as replaceable as any of us. /brInga and I get occasional personal invitations to attend conferences of various kinds. Even though we rarely do so because that means arranging vacation days from work and all that; we do appreciate the offers.

Stuart,,Scott,Chief Information Officer,Microsoft Points – How Much Are They Really Worth?,Microsoft Corporation,www.microsoft.com,Software & Internet : Software & Internet Other,1 Microsoft Way,Redmond,WA,98052,USA,425.882.8080,n/a,10/15/2010,10/15/2010,Termination,Microsoft Points – How Much Are They Really Worth? /brOctober 15; 2010; 5:51 am /br/brWANTED: Experienced IT Manager to oversee all IT services of large; multinational corporation. Will be responsible for security; infrastructure; messaging and business applications for entire company; including support of product groups; corporate business groups; and the global sales and marketing organization. /brWhen a major company fires a major executive; it’s major news; and that’s just what software giant Microsoft did on Tuesday; November 6. The company announced that it had fired its chief information officer; Stuart Scott; for violating company policies./br“Stuart Scott’s employment with Microsoft was terminated after an investigation for violation of company policies;” said spokesman Lou Gellos in a company statement read to the Associated Press./brTo me; Chief Information Officer sounds like someone who’s responsible for communicating information about the company; more like a chief of public relations. However; a chief information officer is actually the person who is in charge of a company’s information technology (IT) department. In Stuart Scott’s case; he was a corporate vice president acting in this capacity. /brAccording to Microsoft’s website; Scott joined Microsoft in July 2005; after 17 years as a CIO for several divisions of General Electric. Originally; he shared CIO duties with Ron Markezich; who was responsible for overseeing the actual IT infrastructure of the company; while Scott was responsible for business processes and applications (see article on Microsoft website). In 2006; the entire responsibility for IT functions was placed under Scott’s responsibility; and Markezich moved on to a position as vice president of Managed Solutions at Microsoft./brThe unspecified violation of company policies is leading to speculation on the internet about the real reason for Scott’s firing. Valleywag has published a rumor (unverified); provided by a tipster; that Scott was having an affair with a VP level employee who reported directly to him. According to the tipster; Scott and the other employee both recently took emergency family leave time; which was actually a cover up for an affair./brIf true; is it really important for Microsoft to police employee bedrooms? Well; let’s see. If these employees actually used family leave time to have an affair; that would be cheating the company (especially if it were paid time off). I’d have a big problem with that. Also; most organizations do have policies about relationships between employees who are actually connected in the organizational chart. For instance; if I were a manager in a company that I didn’t own; I probably wouldn’t be allowed to be my husband’s boss; and if I were single; I probably wouldn’t officially be allowed to date someone I directly supervised. It’s a very common policy./brWhat about anything else that might be a violation of company policy? Microsoft’s Standards of Business Conduct state that employees should manage the company’s business “in compliance with laws and regulatory requirements.” A violation of the law could certainly be grounds for dismissal; but there’s been no indication of that so far in Scott’s case. Other possibilities might include industrial espionage or compromising data security; but we have no indication of that either. Spokesperson Gellos said in his statement that Microsoft has “no further information to share.” That’s as it should be. Personnel decisions are supposed to be confidential – another common company policy./brWhat’s certain is that Microsoft will soon be looking for a new CIO. For now; Gellos says that Scott’s duties will be shared by Alain Crozier; another corporate vice president; and Shahla Aly; a general manager in the services group.,,50K-100K,>-$1 Billion,News,,Stuart Scott was terminated as Chief Information Officer of Microsoft Corporation,Stuart Scott joined Microsoft in July 2005; after 17 years as a CIO for several divisions of General Electric.,Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation; which rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS DOS in the mid 1980s; followed by the Windows line of operating systems.,http://maddixssite.iloveblog.com/2010/10/15/microsoftpointshowmucharetheyreallyworth/
