Roger Wicker; R-Miss.; put a hold on the nomination of Dr. Jonathan Woodson to be assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs. Woodson said at his confirmation hearing on Aug. 3 that he considered development of a new electronic health record for Defense one of his key priorities. Woodson is a vascular surgeon who practices at the Boston Medical Center in Massachusetts and is an associate dean at Boston University.<br/>Tara DiJulio; a spokeswoman for Wicker; said the senator put the nomination on hold because he was concerned about an amendment to the Senate version of the fiscal 2011 Defense authorization bill that would allow military servicewomen to obtain abortion care at military hospitals even if they use their own funds. Wicker spent most of his time at Woodson's confirmation hearing to voice his opposition to the amendment; which Sen. Roland Burris; D-Ill.; sponsored.<br/>DiJulio said Wicker did not believe Woodson adequately addressed concerns about the impact the amendment would have on military hospitals; and he will keep the nomination on hold until Woodson provides detailed answers to questions the senator asked at the hearing.<br/>Campbell's transfer puts development of a new Defense electronic health record system on hold and leaves a leadership vacuum for the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record; a medical record for all service members and veterans that Defense is creating in conjunction with the Veterans Affairs Department; sources told Nextgov.
