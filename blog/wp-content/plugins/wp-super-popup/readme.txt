Creates unblockable, dynamic and fully configurable popups for your blog. It works also if WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache is enabled!

== Description ==

WP Super Popup makes you able to easily **create and manage modal and unblockable popups for your Wordpress blog**.
It is proved that a modal and graphically attractive popup (like the one generated by this plugin) have an high conversion! For example you can use it for creating subscription forms or to promote your product in a viral way.
The popup content can be retrieved from an external URL or directly edited inline thanks to a WYSIWYG editor.
The most powerful features of this plugin regards its competitors are the following:

* **Real WYSIWYG**: The popup content is not affected by the stylesheets of your blog: what you edit is EXACTLY what you will see inside the popup

* **Live preview**: you can directly test any update before saving the configuration options 

* **Full compatibility with any caching plugin**: the cookies are handled on the client side so the plugin is not affected by issues related to a caching system like WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache

**A Pro version with full support and additional features (like visitor email auto-load, exit popup and much more) is also available!**
